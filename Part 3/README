This directory contains some files that you can add to your existing
parser.  This includes a makefile that will compile the additional
interpreter.cpp file and link all of the files together to generate a
supersub.exe executable file.  The interpreter.cpp provides an example
utility that will rename the variables of a parse tree.  Use this as
an example for how to do other parts of the intepreter since most of
the operations that you will need to implement should follow a similar
structure.
